 PROJECT TITLE : STUDENT INDUSTRIAL PRACTICAL RECORD SYSTEM

About:
 Student Industrial Practical Record System (SIPRS) is a system which will replace a traditional 
 Log-book by including all important information and resources of the traditional logbook 
on an online system/platform. Students will be able to fill in their daily activities and weekly summaries during field/ industrial practices on this system 
which will be then submitted to the university.
